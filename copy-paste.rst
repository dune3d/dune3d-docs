Copy / Paste
=============

Since version 1.2, Dune 3D supports copy/paste operations.

Copy / Cut
----------

There are certain restrictions as to which entities can be copied:

 - Only user entities can be copied, i.e. no entities generated by groups
 - Document entities can't be copied
 - If there are entities from multiple workplanes, only the ones in the workplane with the most selected entities will be copied
 - A workplane will only be copied if it's the workplane from above
 - Multiple workplanes cannot be copied (by extension, single workplanes may be copied)

Constraints that only reference to-be copied entities are copied 
automatically even if not selected. Constraints referencing other 
entities are copied only if selected. When cutting, these constraints 
are also added to the buffer even if not selected.

Paste
-----

What happens to in-workplane entities depends on whether the group 
they're pasted into has an active workplane or not. If there is an 
active workplane, in-workplane entities will be pasted into it. Copied 
workplanes will be ignored in that case.

If there is no active workplane and a workplane has been copied, the 
workplane will be pasted with its in-workplane entities.

If there is no active workplane and no workplane has been copied, 
in-workplane entities will not be pasted.

Constraints will only be pasted if all referenced entities are existing 
and are in the current or previous groups in order to not create 
unsupported forward references.
