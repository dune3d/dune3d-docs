symmetric tangents and point-on-bezier are available as well.

.. image:: images/bezier.png

Where to find it: In the "Draw Contour" tool, press :kbd:`b` to switch to
bezier mode or use the "Draw bezier curve in workplane" tool.


Body colors

DXF import and cluster entities

Where to find it: In the create group menu (plus icon below the list of groups),
select "Loft".

Revolve groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to lathe groups that do full 360Â° rotational sweeps, there now
are revolve groups that do circular sweeps over a variable angle.

the menu right away.

STEP models as wireframe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imported STEP models can now be displayed as a wireframe or hidden to reduce clutter
or move anchors that fell inside of the solid:
