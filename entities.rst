Entities
========

Entities are items such as lines, circles or arcs drawn by the user or 
automatically generated by groups.

This list only includes entities that can be drawn by the user.

Entities can either be in a workplane, i.e. in 2D space or in 3D space.
Entities in a workplane can only be created if the current group has an 
active workplane. 

All entities can either be construction or normal entities. 
Construction entities are ignored when finding closed paths for 
creating the solid model. Construction entities are only visible if 
they're in the currently active group or "Previous construction 
entities" has been enabled in the view menu.

2D Line
-------

A line in a workplane defined by its start and end point. It thus adds 
4 degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw contour, Draw line in workplane

2D Arc
-------

An arc in a workplane defined by its start, end and center points. For 
each arc, there's an implicit constraint that constrains the center 
point to have the same distance from both ends. It adds 5 degrees of 
freedom.

An arc with coincident start and end point is a full circle.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw contour, Draw arc in workplane

2D Circle
---------

A circle in a workplane defined by its center point and radius. It adds 
three degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw circle in workplane

2D Bezier curve
---------------

A cubic bezier curve in a workplane defined by its start point, end 
point and two control points. It thus adds 
8 degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw contour, Draw bezier curve in workplane

Since version 1.2

3D Line
-------

A line in 3D space defined by its start and end point. It thus adds 
6 degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: no
:Tool: Draw line in 3D

Workplane
---------

A workplane defines a local 2D coordinate system using an origin 
point and a rotation in 3D space. It adds 6 degrees of freedom: 3 
translational and 3 rotational.

The draw workplane tool automatically rotates the drawn workplane so 
that it best matches the camera angle. This can be toggled by pressing 
:kbd:`a`.

Use the "Constrain workplane normal", "Constrain same orientation" or 
"Lock rotation"
tools to constrain the rotational degrees of freedom.

A workplane's size and name can be changed in the "Selection" tab after 
selecting it.

Workplanes not used in the current group can be hidden in the view menu 
at the bottom of the viewport using the "Hide irrelevant workplanes" 
option.

:In Workplane: no
:Tool: Draw workplane

STEP model
----------

Geometry imported from a STEP file. See :doc:`step-import` for more 
details.

:In Workplane: no
:Tool: Import STEP

2D Point
--------

A point in a workplane defined by its location. It thus adds 
2 degrees of freedom.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw point in workplane

Document
--------

A document entity represents an instance of another loaded document. It adds 6 degrees of freedom: 3 
translational and 3 rotational. To constrain the translational degrees 
of freedom, constrain its origin point.

Similar to STEP entities, document entities reference the file by 
absolute or relative path.

:In Workplane: no
:Tool: Link document

Since version 1.2


Cluster
-------

A cluster entity groups multiple in-workplane entities (lines, bezier, 
arcs, circles) into a single entity that can be scaled and rotated.
See :doc:`cluster` for more details. Rotation, scale and aspect ratio 
can be locked in the selection tab.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Create cluster

Since version 1.2

Text
----

A cluster-like entity containing rendered OpenType text that can be 
scaled and rotated. It has 
multiple anchors on either side:

:Bottom: bottommost point in the rendered text, depends on text 
:Descend: descender of the selected font, doesn't depend on text
:Ascend: ascender of the selected font, doesn't depend on text
:Top: topmost point in the rendered text, depends on text 
:Base: point at y=0

Texts can be converted to clusters for modification using the "Convert 
to cluster" tool.

See the Selection tab for changing the font and locking scale and 
rotation. OpenType features can be set in the font selection dialog.

The rendered lines and curves are stored in the document. This means 
that the text is preserved even if the chosen font isn't available. 
Changing the text though requires the chosen font to be available as 
fonts are not embedded in the document.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Draw text

Since version 1.2

Picture
-------

A bitmap picture in a workplane that can be translated, rotated and 
scaled. Once imported, pictures get stored in the `.d3dpic` folder 
alongside the document. See the selection tab for locking angle or aspect ratio. After 
importing, a picture as four anchors on the corners that can't be 
moved or deleted. Use the "Add anchor" tool to add new anchors at 
arbitrary positions. Once placed, a picture anchor can be moved to a 
new position using the "Move anchor" tool. Anchors can be used for 
aligning entities to points on the picture or for positioning and 
scaling the picture itself.

The paste picture tool can be used to import a bitmap from the 
clipboard.

:In Workplane: yes
:Tool: Import picture / Paste picture

Since version 1.3
